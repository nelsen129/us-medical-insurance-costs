# US Medical Insurance Costs [WIP]

Python portfolio project from Codecademy
Data and concept were provided by Codecademy, but all code is written by me.

This is a data analysis that reads a csv of insurance costs for 1338 people and performs a series of regression to create a cost prediction formula

TODO: 
- [x] Load csv data
- [x] Create linear regression function
- [x] Age
  - [x] Find average age
  - [x] Perform linear regression of age vs. insurance costs
  - [x] Plot age vs. insurance costs
- [ ] BMI
  - [ ] Find average, std dev of BMI
  - [ ] Perform linear regression of bmi vs. insurance costs
  - [ ] Plot bmi vs. insurance costs
- [ ] Children
  - [ ] Find average number of children
  - [ ] Perform linear regression of children vs. insurance costs
  - [ ] Plot children vs. insurance costs
- [ ] Smoker
  - [ ] Find average difference in costs between smoker/non-smoker
  - [ ] Plot differences
- [ ] Region
  - [ ] Find average difference in costs between regions
  - [ ] Plot differences
- [ ] Sex
  - [ ] Find average difference in costs between male/female
  - [ ] Plot difference
- [ ] All
  - [ ] Can we find a linear relationship between all of the variables and costs? What's the error?
