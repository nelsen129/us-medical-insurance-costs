# US Medical Insurance Costs [WIP]

Python portfolio project from Codecademy
Data and concept were provided by Codecademy, but all code is written by me.

This is a data analysis that reads a csv of insurance costs for 1338 people and performs a series of regression to create a cost prediction formula

TODO:

- [x] Create linear regression function
- [x] Age
  - [x] Find average age
  - [x] Perform linear regression of age vs. insurance costs
  - [x] Plot age vs. insurance costs
- [x] BMI
  - [x] Find average BMI
  - [x] Perform linear regression of bmi vs. insurance costs
  - [x] Plot bmi vs. insurance costs
- [x] Children
  - [x] Find average number of children
  - [x] Perform linear regression of children vs. insurance costs
  - [x] Plot children vs. insurance costs
- [x] Smoker
  - [x] Find average difference in costs between smoker/non-smoker
  - [x] Plot differences
- [x] Region
  - [x] Find average difference in costs between regions
  - [x] Plot differences
- [x] Sex
  - [x] Find average difference in costs between male/female
